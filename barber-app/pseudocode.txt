=============================================================

Create an app that enables the cashier to enter
the customer's name and their order. 

Then add that order to a queue that the baristas can
see and give them the ability to mark an order complete.

Completed orders should show which barista completed 
the order and have their own list. Bonus points if the 
app automatically says the customer's name out loud when 
an order is complete.
